    "**Deadline:** Wednesday September 2nd, 11:59PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements for approval:** You need to do two things: 1) Upload a Jupyter Notebook on Blackboard that contains the complete solution to the assigment and 2) Answer the Control question form of the assignment, you should make sure that at least some of the answers are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervision** of this assignment is digital. On Thursday August 27, 1600- the TA will be available for answering questions asked on Piazza and for one-to-one video conferencing on the platform Whereby.com.\n",

    "This assignment is our way of compensating for not lecturing Gaussian elimination and LU-factorisation with pivoting. Many of you have seen this algorithm before. If your background on this method is weak, you can read up on chapters 3.2-3.5 in the text book.\n",

    "In this assignment you are to implement and test a Python-program for doing LU-factorisation with pivoting.\n",
    "In large simulations in real life it is often recommended to use as little memory as possible, and also avoid unnecessary operations that are time consuming. From this point of departure we would like you to make a code that takes the coefficient matrix $A$ as input and returns a representation of the matrices $P$, $L$, and $U$ which solve the equation\n",

We *represent* the matrices in question as follows: The permutation matrix $P$ is $n\\times n$, but is represented as a vector  $\\mathtt{P}$ such that row number $k$ in $P$ is the canonical unit vector $e_{\\mathtt{P}_k}$.

    "**Comment:** In practice there are of course off the shelf implementations both in Python libraries and other places for solving linear systems in an optimal way with respect to accuracy and efficiency. It also happens often that many elements of the coefficient matrix are zero and that can be exploited in various different ways. The solver you make is rather general. Irrespective of whether the code you implement is standard software, it is a useful experience to have written such a program yourself at least once, so that you understand how it works, the kind of errors that may occur etc, and you will gain understanding for instance in error analysis.\n",
